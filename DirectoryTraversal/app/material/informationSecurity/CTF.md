Capture the Flag
================

#### Hack The Box

This pentester training platform/lab is full of machines (boxes) to hack on the different difficulty level. Majority of the content generated by the community and released on the website after the staff's approval. Besides boxes users also can pick static challenges or work on advanced tasks like Fortress or Endgame.

#### Vulnhub
We all learn in different ways: in a group, by yourself, reading books, watching/listening to other people, making notes or things out for yourself. Learning the basics & understanding them is essential; this knowledge can be enforced by then putting it into practice.

Over the years people have been creating these resources and a lot of time has been put into them, creating 'hidden gems' of training material. However, unless you know of them, its hard to discover them.

So VulnHub was born to cover as many as possible, creating a catalogue of 'stuff' that is (legally) 'breakable, hackable & exploitable' - allowing you to learn in a safe environment and practice 'stuff' out.
When something is added to VulnHub's database it will be indexed as best as possible, to try and give you the best match possible for what you're wishing to learn or experiment with.
