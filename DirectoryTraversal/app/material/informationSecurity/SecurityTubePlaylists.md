Security Tube hosts a large range of video tutorials on IT security including penetration testing , exploit development and reverse engineering.

* [SecurityTube Metasploit Framework Expert (SMFE)](http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=10)<br>
This video series covers basics of Metasploit Framework. We will look at why to use metasploit then go on to how to exploit vulnerbilities with help of metasploit and post exploitation techniques with meterpreter.

* [Wireless LAN Security and Penetration Testing Megaprimer](http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=9)<br>
This video series will take you through a journey in wireless LAN (in)security and penetration testing. We will start from the very basics of how WLANs work, graduate to packet sniffing and injection attacks, move on to audit infrastructure vulnerabilities, learn to break into WLAN clients and finally look at advanced hybrid attacks involving wireless and applications.

* [Exploit Research Megaprimer](http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=7)<br>
In this video series, we will learn how to program exploits for various vulnerabilities published online. We will also look at how to use various tools and techniques to find Zero Day vulnerabilities in both open and closed source software.

* [Buffer Overflow Exploitation Megaprimer for Linux](http://www.securitytube.net/groups?operation=view&groupId=4)<br>
In this video series, we will understand the basic of buffer overflows and understand how to exploit them on linux based systems. In later videos, we will also look at how to apply the same principles to Windows and other selected operating systems.
